## Survey Melbourne to find a spot for a Coffee Shop
In the city of **Melbourne, Australia**, there is a coffee culture that started a few decades ago with the establishment of Italian cafes. Melburnians love their coffee, and the city takes proud for having the best coffee and baristas in the country. After Covid hit the city, several restaurants have closed and other weathered the storm. One behavior that changed significantly was the heavy use of coffee shops as a non-so-expensive restaurants by providing light food and a variety of salads. However, there are pockets around Greater Melbourne that lack of coffee shops, which has become more evident when restaurants serving those places had to close, leaving residents without an affordable option to have a coffee or have a bite. 

It would be great __to find the best spot(s) to open a coffee shop by clustering the cityâ€™s current coffee shops and restaurants__ along attributes such as, but not limited to, pricey tier, and rating. The less populated clusters, in terms of number of restaurants and coffee places, with pricey places and not excellent in ratings would be good candidates for opening a coffee shop.
